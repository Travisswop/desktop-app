## System Architecture

### Components Structure

```
components/order/orderId/components/
├── SellerDisputeChallenge.tsx      # Main challenge form component
├── SellerDisputeManagement.tsx     # Order-level dispute management
└── OrderTabs.tsx                   # Updated with seller dispute tab

app/(pages)/seller/disputes/

└── disputeActions.ts               # API actions for dispute operations
```

### Data Flow

```
1. Buyer submits dispute → Dispute created in database
2. Seller receives notification → Views dispute in dashboard
3. Seller submits challenge → Challenge data sent to API
4. Admin reviews challenge → Status updated
5. Seller receives notification → Can view admin response
```

}

// Check file type
const allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'application/pdf'];
if (!allowedTypes.includes(file.type)) {
  throw new Error('Invalid file type');
}
```

#### Authentication Issues
```typescript
// Verify access token
if (!accessToken) {
  router.push('/login');
  return;
}

// Check user role
if (userRole !== 'seller') {
  throw new Error('Unauthorized access');
}
```

#### API Error Handling
```typescript
try {
  const result = await createSellerChallenge(disputeId, challengeData, accessToken);
  if (!result.success) {
    setError(result.message || 'Failed to submit challenge');
  }
} catch (error) {
  setError('Network error. Please try again.');
