- `lucide-react` for icons
- `react-hot-toast` for notifications

### Error Handling

- User-friendly messages when payment details are unavailable
- Safe string operations for truncating IDs and hashes

### Accessibility

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

3. **Payment Receipts**: Generate and download payment receipts
4. **Multi-currency Support**: Display amounts in different currencies
5. **Payment Analytics**: Show payment processing times and success rates

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Dispute System**: Link payment information to dispute resolution

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Payment information displays correctly for Stripe payments
- [ ] Payment information displays correctly for wallet payments
- [ ] Copy functionality works for all copyable fields
- [ ] External links open correctly in new tabs
- [ ] Payment status colors match the payment state
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile devices
- [ ] Graceful handling of missing payment data

### Test Cases
1. **Stripe Payment Order**: Verify card details and payment intent display
2. **Wallet Payment Order**: Verify transaction hash and token amount display
3. **Pending Payment**: Verify appropriate status and limited information
4. **Failed Payment**: Verify error status and available information
5. **Missing Payment Data**: Verify graceful fallback messages

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required.

### Database Changes
No database schema changes required - uses existing order data structure.

### API Changes
No API changes required - leverages existing order endpoints.

## Maintenance

### Code Organization
- Payment-related components are organized under `components/order/orderId/components/`
- Types are centralized in `types/order.types.ts`
- Consistent naming conventions used throughout

### Performance Considerations
- Components use React.memo for optimization
- Minimal re-renders through proper state management
- Efficient string operations for ID truncation

### Security Considerations
- Sensitive payment data is properly masked
- No full card numbers or sensitive tokens exposed
- External links use proper security attributes
